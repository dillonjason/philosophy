# Philosophy

This is a break down of how I believe code should be written. This will
focus on three key parts of coding:

- Writing
- Testing
- Organizing

## Why these three

It is my belief that these three parts of a project are tightly coupled. One of these can not be
at it's best unless the other two are as well.

For example code that is written poorly is very likely to be difficult to test, a project that is
poorly organized is very difficult to write in, a project with poor tests will have inconsistent code, etc.

## Going forward

This repo will be organized starting with these three key values and then will have sub directories used to explain
the best practices for each key. It has been my experience that not all developers read walls of text, due to that
most README will be accompanied by code examples. These code examples will be well documented with a lot of repeat
information from the section's README.

## Order

Each section will be self containing so order doesn't matter, but for the best experience I suggest reading in the following
order:

1. Writing
2. Testing
3. Organizing
